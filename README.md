# embedded_security

This was a workshop as well as a competition for implementing predesigned lightweight security algorithms which are suitable for 8 bit, 16 bit , 32 bit platforms.
Parameters for lightweight cryptography:
1. GE's. Gate Equivalents.
2.Memory Requirements.
3.Power Consumption.
4.Throughput.

Basic Building blocks of cipher designing :
1. S block.
2. bit permutation.
3. Block permutation.
4. circular shift.
see basic_blocks.c and generalised_basic_blocks.c for details

ANU cypher was implemented on ARM Cortex M3 based LPC1768.
